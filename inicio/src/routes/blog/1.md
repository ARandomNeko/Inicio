<h6>Many of you reading this post right now can probably not relate to one of the world’s impactful problems: hunger. Yeah sure, you may have skipped a meal or too, and your stomach may rumble on the days you didn’t eat breakfast. But that’s not the hunger I’m talking about.

I’m talking about the hunger people experience when they have to go to bed hungry every night, with barely anything to eat the whole day. This is the situation for 9.2% of our population. To put that number into perspective, it’s around 800 million people. That’s like an Eras Tour Concert crowd, but 15 thousand times what the normal concert crowd is.

There are a lot of causes to the problem of food insecurity which causes so many people to go hungry every night. Poverty, conflicts, instability, and even climate change are some of the major causes of hunger. Many third world countries with a lack of development in their economy land up as countries of poverty. Many of these third world countries - or even second and first world ones like Ukraine and Russia - have regional/national conflicts with other countries, leading some of their populations to go hungry. And lastly, the changing of weather patterns, natural disasters, and altered growing conditions due to climate change can lead to crop failures and increased food prices, pushing vulnerable populations further into food insecurity. All of these are the root causes for the food insecurity problem around the world.

But is there a solution to this? How can we recover, and help more people have access to food?

There are indeed several potential solutions which can be accomplished by individuals and nations. As individuals, you can reduce food waste from the consumer side. Food companies and producers can also put into practice the reduction of food waste to save more food for those who need it. Farmers and those in the agriculture industry can promote sustainable farming practices such as crop rotation, agroforestry, and organic farming that can enhance food production while preserving ecosystems. The national governments can strengthen their social safety nets, such as food assistance programs and unemployment benefits, to provide a safety cushion for vulnerable populations.

In conclusion, food insecurity is a global challenge with far-reaching consequences. To tackle this issue effectively, we must address its root causes, including poverty, conflict, and climate change, while promoting sustainable agriculture, reducing food waste, and providing social safety nets. By working together at local, national, and international levels, we can make strides toward a world where everyone has access to the nutritious food they need for a healthy and prosperous life.
