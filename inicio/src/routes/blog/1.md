The drive for development and progression as a community is evident in today's political world. Governments are focusing critical resources on the development of Science and Tech, Trade, and Industry industries. However, in the process, they often overlook crucial details. Progression will only avail success when the community is equated. To turn a blind eye to education and combating illiteracy is a fatal error.

Education is empowering. Educating a person is to give them access to knowledge and critical skills required in life. Education is the key to opening the doors to the future that individuals dream of. Government-issued services are often subpar and flawed. Government schools are riddled with issues making them seem backward in nature. They lack the necessary infrastructure, teaching equipment, and widespread attention. The question then arises: If governments cannot tackle the issues of illiteracy if they struggle to provide quality education to the community - and, extension providing equal footing for development, what are the alternatives moving forward.

Ultimately, the responsibility of bridging the gap falls into the hands of ordinary individuals like you and me. When a community member fails to support another, it is our duty to fill that void. For many years, several NGOs have been working toward combating this problem. Despite that, the limited advocacy that this issue has received is concerning. Nobody demands extreme measures from people, and no one expects revolutionary developments. It's the small steps that count. Such student-led initiatives have become quite popular. They often involve volunteering at local schools, crowdfunding to arrange for sufficient resources, conducting drives, or spreading awareness. It is in actions like that that our responsibility is fulfilled. Action on a collective scale is always far more effective. These are all community-based actions and actions that fall along the lines of societal contributions, and it is through these actions that we can make the most difference.
